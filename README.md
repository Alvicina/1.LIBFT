This project consists in creating a C library that will then be use in other projects during the Common Core of 42. Mainly, the functions within the library are handmade implementations of well known functions available in the standard libraries of C. 

This project was first done and finished in a different repo to this one (42 camps provides us with independent repos for each project). Once finished, the project was then copied to my personal repo in gitHub.

In the following pdf you can find the project requirements as specified by 42 campus:
