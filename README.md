This project consists in creating a C library that will then be use in other projects during the Common Core of 42. Mainly, the functions within the library are handmade implementations of well known functions available in the standard libraries of C.

The project was first done and finished in a different repo to this one (42 camps provides us with independent repos for each project). Once finished, the project was then copied to my personal repo in gitHub.

There is also a Makefile to make the compilation process of the library easier. Just download the project folder, and type "make" in the command line of your terminal. A file named libft.a, which is the library, will be created on the current directory. Type "make fclean" to erase the library and all the .o files created during the compilation process.
